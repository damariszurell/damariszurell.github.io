      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disentangling the effects of demography, dispersal and biotic interactions on population and community response to global change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research is supported by an Emmy Noether grant by the German Science Foundation DFG (2018-2023; Grant no. ZU 361.1-1 to Damaris Zurell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the interplay between different drivers of biodiversity change is vital for making robust predictions to novel environments. In BIOPIC, we will develop an integrated modelling framework able to disentangle the complex roles of demography, dispersal and biotic interactions in shaping species niches, and assess their effects on population and community response to global change. The framework and its single components will be validated using a mix of simulated and empirical data, and it will be operationalized for avian communities as test case. In particular, the project will focus on five key research objectives aimed at (1) improving our understanding how life history and environment shape dispersal, (2) improving our understanding how life history and demography shape species’ niches, (3) improving our understanding how biotic interactions shape species’ niches, (4) developing and operationalizing multi-species dynamic distribution models, and (5) developing new biodiversity scenarios for European birds. Overall, the proposed project will improve the scientific basis for model-based biodiversity assessments and increase reliability of biodiversity predictions for broad spatial scales by providing both theoretical and conceptual advancements and by defining practical requirements and guidelines for the development and application of biodiversity models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding and predicting multispecies assemblages and interactions in space and time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research was supported by the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007– 2013) under REA grant agreement no. 624958 to Damaris Zurell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding and modelling biotic interactions and their dynamics are prerequisite for predicting community and biodiversity response to climate change and, thus, for designing strategies and policies to halt the loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. We investigate uncertainties in biodiversity response to climate change by improving and integrating existing approaches for modelling biotic interactions in large-scale multispecies assemblages, taking into account reciprocal effects between species and their abiotic and biotic environment as well as variations in biotic interactions across space and time, and considering macroecological constraints on species assemblages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In brief, we will combine extensive empirical and theoretical analyses in order to define practical requirements and guidelines for the implementation of community assemblage predictions.
we will implement algorithms for describing biotic interactions between species and functional groups, using a hierarchical Bayesian approach. Algorithms will be benchmarked using species assemblage data on birds, butterflies and plants, mainly from Switzerland but also from other parts of Europe.
we will test the effects of different interaction mechanisms and data limitations on model performance using data from simulated communities
we will combine our multispecies interaction models with macroecological models to predict species richness and species compositions for an ensemble of climate change scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrating dynamic and statistical modelling approaches in order to improve predictions for scenarios of environmental change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my PhD research, supported by the University of Potsdam Graduate School on Ecological Modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Species respond to environmental change by dynamically adjusting their geographical ranges. Robust predictions of these changes are prerequisites to inform dynamic and sustainable conservation strategies. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) relate species’ occurrence records to prevailing environmental factors to describe the environmental niche. They have been widely applied in global change context as they have comparably low data requirements and allow for rapid assessments of potential future species’ distributions. However, due to their static nature, transient responses to environmental change are essentially ignored in SDMs. Furthermore, neither dispersal nor demographic processes and biotic interactions are explicitly incorporated. Therefore, it has often been suggested to link statistical and mechanistic modelling approaches in order to make more realistic predictions of species’ distributions for scenarios of environmental change (e.g. Gutt et al. 2012). Here, we studied two different ways of such linkage. (i) Mechanistic modelling can act as virtual playground for testing statistical models and allows extensive exploration of specific questions. This ‘virtual ecologist’ approach is a powerful evaluation framework for testing sampling protocols, analyses and modelling tools (Zurell et al. 2010). We employed such an approach to systematically assess the effects of transient dynamics and ecological properties and processes on the prediction accuracy of SDMs for climate change projections (Zurell et al. 2009). That way, relevant mechanisms were identified that shape the species’ response to altered environmental conditions and which should hence be considered when trying to project species’ distribution through time. (ii) We supplemented SDM projections of potential future habitat for black grouse in Switzerland with an individual-based population model (Zurell et al. 2012a). By explicitly considering complex interactions between habitat availability and demographic processes, this allows for a more direct assessment of expected population response to environmental change and associated extinction risks. However, predictions were highly variable across simulations emphasising the need for principal evaluation tools like sensitivity analysis to assess uncertainty and robustness in dynamic range predictions. Furthermore, we identified data coverage of the environmental niche as a likely cause for contrasted range predictions between SDM algorithms (Zurell et al. 2012b). SDMs may fail to make reliable predictions for truncated and edge niches, meaning that portions of the niche are not represented in the data or niche edges coincide with data limits.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaling from individual interactions to community dynamics in avian assemblages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research is supported by an Ambizione fellowship by the Swiss National Science Foundation (2016-2019; Grant no. PZ00P3_168136 to Damaris Zurell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biodiversity loss due to global environmental change is expected to increase rapidly throughout the 21st century posing a major challenge to nature conservation and society. In order to anticipate and mitigate negative impacts on ecosystem functions and services, models are needed that reliably depict the abiotic and biotic drivers that determine species and community response to environmental change. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) have been widely used in this context, but remain criticised for only implicitly accounting for interspecific interactions and for not being able to properly disentangle the fundamental and realised niche of a species. Recently, new tools have been introduced that integrate SDMs with community ecological methods of co-occurrence analyses. So-called joint species distribution models (JSDMs) simultaneously estimate the distribution of multiple species and allow partitioning species co-occurrence patterns into species-specific environmental responses and residual correlations between species, which may result from interspecific interactions but also from unmeasured environmental factors. JSDMs provide an exciting development in macroecology and community ecology, but are still in its infancy with few available applications and without rigorous evaluation. Important questions remain regarding, for example, the scale dependence and spatiotemporal variation in interspecific interaction mechanisms and their effect on JSDM performance, the specific data needed for reliably identifying these mechanisms, and the applicability of JSDMs for climate impact assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project will focus on Swiss avian communities and aims at: (1) evaluating the ability of JSDMs to detect and reliably quantify different interspecific interaction mechanisms, and to predict avian communities under scenarios of climate change; (2) evaluating the scale dependence of interspecific interaction processes in avian assemblages and their relation to functional traits; (3) assessing the extent of spatial and temporal variation in interspecific interactions for selected bird assemblages; and (4) incorporating trait information into JSDMs to understand how behavioural syndromes mediate interspecific interactions in birds. To achieve these goals, the project will make use of the extensive bird monitoring programmes of Switzerland in close collaboration with the Swiss Ornithological Institute, supplemented by targeted simulation experiments that allow testing the models against specific underlying assumptions. The project is expected to provide both theoretical and conceptual advancements in model-based predictions of species range and community changes by explicitly studying the link between local scale biotic interactions and large-scale avian community patterns, and by combining extensive empirical and theoretical analyses to define practical requirements and guidelines for the implementation of community assemblage predictions. Moreover, it will help understanding the complexities of Swiss avian assemblages and help anticipating potential environmental change-induced changes to Swiss avian diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving species biodiversity analyses and citizen science feedback through mining data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interdisciplinary project funded by the Swiss Data Science Center (ETH board, 2017-2019; awarded to Niklaus E. Zimmermann, and co-PIs Dirk N. Karger and Damaris Zurell).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to conserve and manage biodiversity, we need an improved understanding of essential biodiversity drivers and improved predictions of resulting biodiversity patterns in space and time. Here, we propose a novel approach based on data-mining and iterative machine learning to improve biodiversity models and to better exploit existing data as well as guide future data sampling efforts. Modern data-mining techniques are destined to improve traditional species distribution modelling. On the one hand, massive amounts of biodiversity data are becoming available through citizen science and technical advances in monitoring, with increasing data of species occurrence, morphological traits, evolutionary history, and environmental variables. On the other hand, these data are often incomplete in that clear sampling designs are missing and information is not equally accurate or complete for all species. These data gaps could be filled by modern machine learning algorithms that are able to find a way through the maze of uncertainties in these data, in which scientists so easily get lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applicable to any species group world-wide, the proposed project will focus on floristic data from Switzerland as a pilot system to set up and study the benefits of data-mining and machine learning techniques for facilitating biodiversity assessments. Structured into four work packages, the project will combine various data sources in a novel way and foster the link between ecological sciences and citizen science. By that, it will pave the way towards automated quality checks in citizen science data, improved uncertainty analyses and identification of hidden information in large scale biodiversity inventories, and real-time guidance of observer efforts in citizen science based data collection. Key milestones of the project include: a) an operative framework linking real-time data streams and a citizen science interface, b) iteratively model the distribution of individual species and associated spatiotemporal uncertainty patterns using machine learning and data-mining, c) a meta-learning to detect ecologically relevant, higher-level processes structuring biodiversity, and d) a model-based catalogue of criteria for guiding citizen scientists for improved data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
