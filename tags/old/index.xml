      <description>Understanding and predicting multispecies assemblages and interactions in space and time
This research was supported by the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007– 2013) under REA grant agreement no. 624958 to Damaris Zurell.
Summary
Understanding and modelling biotic interactions and their dynamics are prerequisite for predicting community and biodiversity response to climate change and, thus, for designing strategies and policies to halt the loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services.</description>

      <description>Integrating dynamic and statistical modelling approaches in order to improve predictions for scenarios of environmental change
This was my PhD research, supported by the University of Potsdam Graduate School on Ecological Modelling.
Summary
Species respond to environmental change by dynamically adjusting their geographical ranges. Robust predictions of these changes are prerequisites to inform dynamic and sustainable conservation strategies. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) relate species’ occurrence records to prevailing environmental factors to describe the environmental niche.</description>
