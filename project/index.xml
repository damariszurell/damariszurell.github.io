      <description>Moving from pattern towards process for improved forecasts of species range dynamics
This exchange project (2019-2020) is supported by the DAAD (Grant to Damaris Zurell) and the University of Melbourne (Grant to Gurutzeta Guillera-Arroita)
Summary
Forecasts of where species are likely to occur in the future are important for informed species management. Predictions help in conserving populations that may otherwise be lost, or detecting invasive or harmful species that might otherwise be overlooked.</description>

      <description>Disentangling the effects of demography, dispersal and biotic interactions on population and community response to global change
This research is supported by an Emmy Noether grant by the German Science Foundation DFG (2018-2023; Grant no. ZU 361.1-1 to Damaris Zurell)
Summary
Understanding the interplay between different drivers of biodiversity change is vital for making robust predictions to novel environments. In BIOPIC, we will develop an integrated modelling framework able to disentangle the complex roles of demography, dispersal and biotic interactions in shaping species niches, and assess their effects on population and community response to global change.</description>

      <description>Understanding and predicting multispecies assemblages and interactions in space and time
This research was supported by the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007– 2013) under REA grant agreement no. 624958 to Damaris Zurell.
Summary
Understanding and modelling biotic interactions and their dynamics are prerequisite for predicting community and biodiversity response to climate change and, thus, for designing strategies and policies to halt the loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services.</description>

      <description>Integrating dynamic and statistical modelling approaches in order to improve predictions for scenarios of environmental change
This was my PhD research, supported by the University of Potsdam Graduate School on Ecological Modelling.
Summary
Species respond to environmental change by dynamically adjusting their geographical ranges. Robust predictions of these changes are prerequisites to inform dynamic and sustainable conservation strategies. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) relate species’ occurrence records to prevailing environmental factors to describe the environmental niche.</description>

      <description>Scaling from individual interactions to community dynamics in avian assemblages
This research is supported by an Ambizione fellowship by the Swiss National Science Foundation (2016-2019; Grant no. PZ00P3_168136 to Damaris Zurell)
Summary
Biodiversity loss due to global environmental change is expected to increase rapidly throughout the 21st century posing a major challenge to nature conservation and society. In order to anticipate and mitigate negative impacts on ecosystem functions and services, models are needed that reliably depict the abiotic and biotic drivers that determine species and community response to environmental change.</description>

      <description>Improving species biodiversity analyses and citizen science feedback through mining data
Interdisciplinary project funded by the Swiss Data Science Center (ETH board, 2017-2019; awarded to Niklaus E. Zimmermann, and co-PIs Dirk N. Karger and Damaris Zurell).
Summary
In order to conserve and manage biodiversity, we need an improved understanding of essential biodiversity drivers and improved predictions of resulting biodiversity patterns in space and time. Here, we propose a novel approach based on data-mining and iterative machine learning to improve biodiversity models and to better exploit existing data as well as guide future data sampling efforts.</description>
