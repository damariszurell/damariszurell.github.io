      <description>Scaling from individual interactions to community dynamics in avian assemblages
This research is supported by an Ambizione fellowship by the Swiss National Science Foundation (2016-2019; Grant no. PZ00P3_168136 to Damaris Zurell)
Summary
Biodiversity loss due to global environmental change is expected to increase rapidly throughout the 21st century posing a major challenge to nature conservation and society. In order to anticipate and mitigate negative impacts on ecosystem functions and services, models are needed that reliably depict the abiotic and biotic drivers that determine species and community response to environmental change.</description>

      <description>Understanding and predicting multispecies assemblages and interactions in space and time
This research was supported by the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007– 2013) under REA grant agreement no. 624958 to Damaris Zurell.
Summary
Understanding and modelling biotic interactions and their dynamics are prerequisite for predicting community and biodiversity response to climate change and, thus, for designing strategies and policies to halt the loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services.</description>

      <description>Integrating dynamic and statistical modelling approaches in order to improve predictions for scenarios of environmental change
This was my PhD research, supported by the University of Potsdam Graduate School on Ecological Modelling.
Summary
Species respond to environmental change by dynamically adjusting their geographical ranges. Robust predictions of these changes are prerequisites to inform dynamic and sustainable conservation strategies. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) relate species’ occurrence records to prevailing environmental factors to describe the environmental niche.</description>
